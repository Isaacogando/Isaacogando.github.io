   <p> Hello. My name is Isaac Ogando. I am just began my coding journey with this program. I've always loved technology growing up and seeing all of tech's rapid advancements in real time has sparked my interest in being
       apart of this field. I would like to view myself as a creative person but never was given the ability to draw or things like that. I have found that coding has given me the plateform to essentially create
      with an endless canvas. </p>
